### World
Replace `USER_NAME = 'caps'` in `purikone.py` with your own Windows username. That is, your user folder name.

Run `python purikone.py`.

### Victory!
If the extracted audio doesn't play, it means that you got the bad ending.

Actually, it means that encryption has changed. Consult with the good folk from the `vgmstream` repository.
